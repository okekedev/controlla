- Automatic updates when you publish new versions

## Updating the App

For version 1.1 and beyond:

```bash

<Version>1.1.0</Version>

# 2. Update Package.appxmanifest
<Identity Version="1.1.0.0" />

# 3. Build new MSIX
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:WindowsPackageType=MSIX

# 4. Upload to Partner Center
# 5. Submit new version for certification
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "Windows SDK not found"
```bash
# Install Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0 or later
# Download from: https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/
```

### Package validation errors
- Ensure all assets exist in Assets/ folder
- Check Package.appxmanifest has correct identity
- Verify version numbers match

### App crashes after install from Store
- This is usually due to missing capabilities in manifest
- Ensure `runFullTrust` capability is declared
- Check network capabilities are enabled

## Comparison: GitHub Releases vs Microsoft Store

| Feature | GitHub Releases | Microsoft Store |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Cost | Free | Free (individual account) |
| Discoverability | Low (need direct link) | High (searchable in Store) |
| Trust | Lower (exe warning) | Higher (Microsoft signed) |
| Auto-updates | No | Yes (automatic) |
| Installation | Manual download | One-click install |
| Distribution | Direct .exe | MSIX package |

**Recommendation:** Publish to BOTH
- GitHub Releases: For power users, direct downloads, transparency
- Microsoft Store: For mainstream users, discoverability, trust
